Lesson 1
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
a) By pinpointing that there was a difference.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
a) Because it will allow you to check out changes that were made before.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
a) Manual commits can be more specific and have more detail, while automatic commits might be too vague and contain too much.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
a) Because the changes being saved in the different files might have interactions with each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
a)By looking at the commits using git log you can see the changes made, and by using git diff you can compare the changes that were made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
a) Cause you have the safety net to go make and see what changes made everything break.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
a) Checking different versions!
